# Learning Project 
Project where I want to practice knowledge of creating simple mobile apps with PhoneGap & Vue.js
## Usage
You can add folder 'pg' to your PhoneGap desktop app and run it as PhoneGap project.
To run project with [vue-cli] under main folder:
    npm run serve
To put changes into 'pg' (PhoneGap compiled project):
    npm run pg
If you need to install modules:
    npm install
